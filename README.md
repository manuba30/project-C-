It's just a simple project that creates a login page, using the information you have in your Microsoft MySQL database.
If the information entered doesn't match, it will display an error; if it's correct, it will take you to an empty page.
The 'Clear' button clears the information, and the 'Exit' button shows a pop-up where you can choose to quit or stay with the application.

Thanks for reading !
